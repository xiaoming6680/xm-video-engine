# Claude Animation

**Hand-drawn 2D animation, written as code.** Give it a story and get a frame-exact MP4 that looks drawn:
paper grain, hatching, brush ink, watercolour that blooms, glossy characters with real anatomy, whole worlds
in cross-section, and sound synthesised from the same timeline as the picture.

## Why this exists

Ask a model to "animate a story in JavaScript" and you get flat shapes sliding around. What makes code look
drawn isn't the model, it's **a vocabulary of detail** and **a habit of looking**. This skill is both,
written down after making the films:

**1. A detail bible.** Every surface gets base → texture → edge. Soil is hatch + strata + pebbles; chitin is a
gradient with form hatch, a specular streak, rim light and setae; leaves have serrated edges and pale veins;
fungus is a spongy mass that grows. Line weight falls off with depth. The skill makes the model ask for
detail surface by surface instead of hoping for it.

**2. Rigs with anatomy.** The ant has a segmented gaster, a petiole node, a humped thorax, a compound eye with
two highlights, toothed mandibles that open, elbowed beaded antennae, and six legs with femur, knee, tibia,
tarsus and claws, walking on a real tripod gait. It can carry, chew, rear up, sweat, blink, be a queen — and
draw itself in layers: sketch, ink, colour, polish.

![the ant rig: walk phases, holding, sniffing, carrying, flipped](docs/ant-poses.png)

**3. A colony kit.** Leaves you can cut, leaf pieces to carry, eggs, larvae, cocoons, stores, a fungus garden,
roots, and `nestCanvas()` — chambers and tunnels baked into textured soil, returning paths an ant can walk.

**4. A harness that makes you look.** `sheet`, `strip` (12 consecutive frames around a fast action),
`verify` (a frame must be identical rendered in or out of order), and a staged `render` that never
overwrites a good file with a failed encode.

## The example films

`examples/money-quest/` — a 30 s two-character adventure: a chibi person rig (built from a cartoon model
sheet) and the orange critter go from an empty wallet to a treasure chest: map, idea forest, a canyon the
critter bridges by stretching flat, a staircase of giant cards, JACKPOT.

![crossing the canyon on the critter-bridge](docs/money-quest.jpg)


`examples/claude-balloon/` — a 30 s seamless loop in faceted low-poly poster style: the orange hero drifts
through a dusk canyon in a hot-air balloon, birds cross, clouds wrap, the river shimmers. Ambient score.

![the balloon loop](docs/balloon.jpg)


`examples/claude-game/` — 30 s, 16:9 video-game short: an orange block hero runs, jumps and flips across
a textured platform level, punches, kicks and stomps bugs, then fights a boss. Hit-stop on every contact,
screen shake, sparks, comic words, damage numbers, a combo counter, a boss HP bar, a charged special, K.O.,
LEVEL CLEAR. Chiptune soundtrack and 132 sound effects, all synthesised.

### The colony


`examples/ant-colony/` — 32 s, 16:9. "This is code." → the ant built from sketch to polish → a leafcutter
cuts a leaf and carries it through a meadow in a column of others → a dive into the mound → the nest in
cross-section: the leaf goes onto the fungus garden, the nursery, the queen laying, and a pull-back to the
whole colony as day turns to night. 240 sound cues, one music bed, all synthesised. Renders in ~27 s.

![the example, one frame per second](docs/colony-contact.jpg)

```bash
cd plugins/claude-animation/skills/claude-animation && npm install && cd -
cd examples/ant-colony && ./make.sh        # -> out/ant-colony-final.mp4
